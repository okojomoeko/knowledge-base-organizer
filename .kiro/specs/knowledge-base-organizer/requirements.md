# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a knowledge base organizer specifically designed for Obsidian vaults and markdown-based note systems. The system focuses on note quality improvement through frontmatter validation, automatic link generation, and dead link detection. It provides CLI-based operations with structured output formats (CSV, JSON) for automation and integration with other tools.

The application prioritizes frontmatter standardization, intelligent WikiLink generation from plain text, and comprehensive link validation to maintain a high-quality knowledge base.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an Obsidian user, I want to validate and fix frontmatter in my notes according to template-based schemas, so that my knowledge base maintains consistent metadata structure without corrupting existing valid frontmatter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a vault directory path THEN the system SHALL scan all markdown files recursively with configurable include/exclude patterns
2. WHEN scanning files THEN the system SHALL parse frontmatter metadata (title, aliases, tags, id, date, publish status)
3. WHEN running without `--template` option THEN the system SHALL only validate and report issues without modifying any files
4. WHEN running with `--template <template_file_path>` option THEN the system SHALL use that template file's frontmatter as the schema reference
5. WHEN a file's frontmatter already matches the template schema THEN the system SHALL not modify that file
6. WHEN a file's frontmatter has valid values that don't conflict with the template THEN the system SHALL preserve those values
7. WHEN frontmatter is invalid THEN the system SHALL identify missing fields and rule violations based on the template schema
8. WHEN I run interactive mode THEN the system SHALL prompt for corrections to frontmatter issues
9. WHEN I run automatic mode with `--execute` THEN the system SHALL apply template-based fixes to frontmatter while preserving existing valid values
10. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL output results in CSV/JSON format for further processing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an Obsidian user, I want to automatically generate WikiLinks from plain text mentions, so that my notes are properly interconnected without manual linking effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning note content THEN the system SHALL detect text that matches other notes' titles or aliases
2. WHEN detecting matches THEN the system SHALL exclude text within existing WikiLinks ([[...]])
3. WHEN detecting matches THEN the system SHALL exclude text within regular markdown links ([...](...))
4. WHEN detecting matches THEN the system SHALL exclude text within frontmatter sections
5. WHEN detecting matches THEN the system SHALL exclude text within Link Reference Definitions
6. WHEN detecting matches THEN the system SHALL consider table content as configurable (include/exclude option)
7. WHEN matches are found THEN the system SHALL automatically convert plain text to WikiLink format [[id|alias]]
8. WHEN generating WikiLinks THEN the system SHALL use the file ID and appropriate alias from the target note's frontmatter
9. WHEN link generation is complete THEN the system SHALL output a report of all links created

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an Obsidian user, I want to detect and report dead links in my vault, so that I can maintain link integrity and fix broken references.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning WikiLinks THEN the system SHALL identify links in format [[id]] and [[id|alias]] that point to non-existent files
2. WHEN scanning regular markdown links THEN the system SHALL identify broken links like [un-link]() with empty or invalid targets
3. WHEN detecting dead links THEN the system SHALL report the source file, line number, and broken link text
4. WHEN generating dead link reports THEN the system SHALL output results in CSV/JSON format with structured data
5. WHEN I run with dry-run mode THEN the system SHALL only report issues without making changes
6. WHEN dead links are found THEN the system SHALL suggest potential fixes based on similar file names or aliases

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an Obsidian user, I want to aggregate and merge notes based on tags or search criteria, so that I can create consolidated views of related information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify tag criteria THEN the system SHALL find all notes matching the specified tags
2. WHEN I specify search criteria THEN the system SHALL find notes matching content or metadata patterns
3. WHEN aggregating notes THEN the system SHALL merge content into a single markdown file

6. WHEN I use help commands THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive usage information with examples
7. WHEN running commands THEN the system SHALL support verbose logging for debugging and audit trails

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an Obsidian user, I want flexible configuration options for directory filtering and processing rules, so that I can customize the tool for my specific vault structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN configuring THEN the system SHALL allow customization of frontmatter schema templates
3. WHEN configuring THEN the system SHALL support custom WikiLink patterns and alias matching rules
4. WHEN configuring THEN the system SHALL allow table content processing to be enabled/disabled
5. WHEN no config exists THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults for standard Obsidian vaults
6. WHEN config is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation error messages with examples

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As an Obsidian user, I want the system to handle YAML type conversion intelligently, so that my frontmatter validation succeeds even when YAML automatically converts my ID numbers and dates to native types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a frontmatter contains an `id` field with an integer value THEN the system SHALL convert it to a string before validation
2. WHEN a frontmatter contains a `date` field with a date object THEN the system SHALL convert it to an ISO format string before validation
3. WHEN a frontmatter contains boolean values that should be strings THEN the system SHALL convert them to string representations
4. WHEN a frontmatter contains numeric values in fields expecting strings THEN the system SHALL convert them to string representations
5. WHEN a frontmatter field is already a string THEN the system SHALL leave it unchanged
